# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement rate limiting and abuse protection to prevent spam and abuse of the bot
# Details:
Implement per-user rate limiting using Redis or in-memory store. Add cooldown periods for Jenkins job triggers per user/job combination. Create sliding window rate limiting algorithm. Add suspicious activity detection (rapid requests, unusual patterns). Implement progressive penalties for abuse. Add whitelist/blacklist functionality for users. Log rate limiting events for monitoring.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for rate limiting algorithms and cooldown logic. Integration tests with multiple concurrent users. Test abuse detection and penalty systems. Performance tests under high request volume.
