# Task ID: 11
# Title: Generic MCP Tool Integration Architecture Refactor
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the AI agent service to support generic MCP tool integration instead of being Jenkins-specific, implementing type interfaces, registry system, and configuration management.
# Details:
1. Create new TypeScript interfaces for AI agent responses:
   - Define `IMCPToolResponse` interface with common response properties
   - Create specialized interfaces for different response types (text, interactive, file, etc.)
   - Implement serialization/deserialization methods for these interfaces

2. Implement MCP registry system for dynamic tool discovery:
   - Create `MCPToolRegistry` class to manage available MCP tools
   - Implement registration methods with metadata (capabilities, permissions, etc.)
   - Add discovery mechanism for tools to register themselves at runtime
   - Create configuration schema for tool definitions

3. Refactor AI processor for tool selection:
   - Update `AIProcessor` class to dynamically select appropriate tools based on user intent
   - Implement tool capability matching algorithm
   - Add fallback mechanisms when no suitable tool is found
   - Create abstraction layer between AI processing and tool execution

4. Update Slack bot service for generic tool handling:
   - Modify message processing pipeline to support multiple tool types
   - Implement response formatting for different tool response types
   - Add error handling for tool-specific failures
   - Create unified interface for tool interaction

5. Add configuration system for MCP servers:
   - Implement environment variable support for multiple MCP server configurations
   - Create configuration validation schema for MCP servers
   - Add runtime configuration management for adding/removing servers
   - Implement secure credential storage for MCP server authentication

6. Migrate existing Jenkins-specific code:
   - Create Jenkins adapter implementing the new MCP tool interfaces
   - Update existing Jenkins functionality to use the new architecture
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing Jenkins jobs
   - Add migration documentation

7. Implement proper dependency injection:
   - Use a DI container (e.g., TypeDI, InversifyJS) for better testability
   - Create service interfaces for all components
   - Configure service resolution at application startup

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for all new interfaces and classes
   - Test MCPToolRegistry with mock tool implementations
   - Verify AI processor tool selection logic with various input scenarios
   - Test configuration validation with valid and invalid configurations
   - Ensure proper error handling for all edge cases

2. Integration Testing:
   - Create integration tests for the complete tool execution pipeline
   - Test dynamic tool discovery and registration
   - Verify proper handling of different response types in Slack
   - Test configuration changes at runtime
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing Jenkins functionality

3. Mock Testing:
   - Create mock MCP servers for testing different tool types
   - Simulate various response scenarios and error conditions
   - Test timeout and failure handling
   - Verify proper message formatting in Slack for all response types

4. End-to-End Testing:
   - Test complete user workflows with actual Slack and MCP server instances
   - Verify proper tool selection based on user intent
   - Test performance under load with multiple concurrent requests
   - Ensure security of MCP server credentials

5. Documentation Verification:
   - Verify API documentation accuracy for all new interfaces
   - Test example code in documentation
   - Ensure configuration documentation is complete and accurate
