# Task ID: 8
# Title: Test Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests
# Details:
Set up Jest testing framework with TypeScript support. Create unit tests for all service classes (SlackBotService, AIProcessor, MCPClient, JenkinsService). Implement integration tests for Slack webhook handling and Jenkins job triggering. Add mock implementations for external dependencies (Slack API, Jenkins API, AI services). Create test utilities for common scenarios. Set up code coverage reporting with >80% target.

# Test Strategy:
Test the tests themselves with mutation testing. Verify mock accuracy against real API responses. Set up CI/CD pipeline integration for automated testing. Create performance benchmarks and regression tests.
