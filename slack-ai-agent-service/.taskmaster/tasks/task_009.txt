# Task ID: 9
# Title: Additional Security Hardening
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement additional security measures including request verification and secure logging
# Details:
Implement Slack request signing verification using HMAC-SHA256. Add secure logging practices (no sensitive data, structured logging). Implement CORS headers and security middleware. Add input validation middleware for all endpoints. Implement secure secret management using environment variables or secret management services. Add security headers (helmet.js). Implement request size limits and timeout controls.

# Test Strategy:
Security testing with invalid signatures, oversized requests, and malicious headers. Test logging output for sensitive data leaks. Verify CORS and security header implementation. Penetration testing for common web vulnerabilities.
